# Together: a Weighted Multi-Signature Wallet

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of "Together" a groundbreaking project designed to revolutionize multi-signature wallets by incorporating a dynamic and flexible weighted approval system. In an era where blockchain technology has opened up new horizons for secure and decentralized financial transactions, "Together" stands as a pioneering concept that aims to enhance the efficiency and security of collaborative decision-making within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

At its core, "Together" is a smart contract platform built on Mina, leveraging the unparalleled power of the SnarkyJS programming language and TypeScript to ensure a robust and secure implementation. The primary objective of this project is to develop a weighted multi-signature wallet, which allows transactions to be executed based on predefined weight thresholds. By empowering users with individual weights and enabling various combinations of approvals, "Together" grants businesses and organizations the flexibility they need to tailor transaction approval processes according to their specific requirements.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the inception of "Together" lies in addressing the unique challenges faced by businesses and organizations that rely on collaborative decision-making within the blockchain space. Traditional multi-signature wallets often employ a simplistic approach where each user holds an equal weight in the approval process. However, real-world scenarios demand a more sophisticated system that considers the importance and influence of each participant.

For instance, consider a business where stakeholders possess different levels of expertise, financial backing, or seniority. In such cases, it becomes crucial to assign varying weights to individual participants to reflect their significance accurately. Moreover, the ability to establish complex approval conditions, including recursive implementations, enhances the security and adaptability of the system.

## Tools Used

To realize the full potential of the "Together" project, we have employed two key technologies: SnarkyJS and TypeScript.

1. **SnarkyJS:** SnarkyJS is an invaluable tool for developing succinct zero-knowledge proofs, providing a higher degree of privacy and security. By employing this technology, "Together" can implement robust verification mechanisms, ensuring that the execution of transactions adheres strictly to the defined weight thresholds. This enhances the confidentiality of user weights and transaction details, making "Together" an ideal choice for businesses that prioritize privacy.

2. **TypeScript (TS):** TypeScript brings the benefits of strong static typing to our project. By adopting TypeScript, we can significantly reduce the likelihood of runtime errors, enhance code readability, and improve the overall development experience. This helps us build a more reliable and maintainable smart contract platform, making "Together" an ideal solution for enterprises that emphasize a strong foundation of code quality.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind "Together" can be traced back to the fundamental principles of decentralized finance and community governance. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, we are witnessing an increasing need for adaptable, secure, and user-centric financial solutions. By drawing inspiration from existing multi-signature wallet implementations and combining it with innovative approaches to weighted approvals, "Together" has emerged as a unique and compelling project that addresses the specific demands of businesses and organizations in the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies.

The vision behind "Together" is to empower businesses with a decentralized, trustless, and transparent platform that harmonizes the diverse interests of stakeholders, fostering a stronger sense of collaboration and synergy. With its focus on flexibility, security, and privacy, "Together" aims to redefine the way we approach collaborative decision-making in the world of blockchain, paving the way for a more inclusive and resilient financial future.
